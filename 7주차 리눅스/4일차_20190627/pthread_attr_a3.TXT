# ./a.out -mf10 -ar20 -i e
Scheduler settings of main thread
    policy=SCHED_FIFO, priority=10

Scheduler settings in 'attr'
    policy=SCHED_RR, priority=20
    inheritsched is EXPLICIT

Scheduler attributes of new thread
    policy=SCHED_RR, priority=20
In the above output, one can see that the scheduling policy and priority were taken from the values specified in the thread attributes object.

The next run is the same as the previous, except that the inherit scheduler attribute is set to PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED, meaning that threads created using the thread attributes object should ignore the scheduling attributes specified in the attributes object and instead take their scheduling attributes from the creating thread.

# ./a.out -mf10 -ar20 -i i
Scheduler settings of main thread
    policy=SCHED_FIFO, priority=10

Scheduler settings in 'attr'
    policy=SCHED_RR, priority=20
    inheritsched is INHERIT

Scheduler attributes of new thread
    policy=SCHED_FIFO, priority=10
In the above output, one can see that the scheduling policy and priority were taken from the creating thread, rather than the thread attributes object.

Note that if we had omitted the -i i option, the output would have been the same, since PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED is the default for the inherit scheduler attribute.
